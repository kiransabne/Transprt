# Transprt
Open-source Uber app written in swift 3 and utilizing Parse server.

transprt is an open-source Uber app. It allows users to sign up as riders or drivers, login to their own accounts, request or accept rides, see details and current distance from rider/driver, and for drivers to get directions to the users requesting a ride automatically after accepting a request.

AppDelegate file was removed to omit private security keys for Parse server backend, and would need to be added to successfully compile the app. Please contact me (http://rlabs.tech/contact-me/) if you need any help with this.
